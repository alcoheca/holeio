# Hole.io
[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/anonfunc/holeio.png?label=ready)](http://waffle.io/anonfunc/holeio)

Hole.io is a "blackhole" downloader for [Put.io]("http://put.io") which does the following:
* Watches a "blackhole" directory for added torrent files
* Uploads the torrents to Put.io
* Watches the transfers for completion
* Downloads the completed files

Since I'm not dumb enough to intentionally check in my OAuth client secret for Put.io, you'll need to register an application to 
connect to Put.io.  See https://put.io/v2/docs/gettingstarted.html#sign-up and https://put.io/v2/oauth2/register.

You will be able to enter these into the configuration page to get connected.

## Category support

If you have subdirectories (one level deep) in the blackhole directory, they will be treated as "categories" and 
both Put.io transfers and the eventually downloaded files will be in subdirectories.
